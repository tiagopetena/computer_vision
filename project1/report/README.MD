report: a directory containing the source files that produce your report. Your report must be written using
LATEX (and friends) and compiled within the pipeline of the repository. Consequently, the PDF must not be
committed. You can use the images from adnrv/texlive to build your PDFs. Only the PDF of the report
must be added to the artifacts path on the .gitlab-ci.yml setup, and not other intermediary files of
your report (e.g., images, log files, auxiliary files).

Your report must show all your work for the given project, including images (labeled appropriately, that
is, in accordance with the convention given) and other outputs needed to explain and convey your work.
When needed include explanations to the questions given in the project.
